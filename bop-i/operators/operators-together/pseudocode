index.html has the html structure
style.css has the styling
sketch.js has the main logic
main.js has the user information

sketch.js has to get the user information from main.js and
- render the correct number of fruit (so, apple changes from 1 to 3 and 2 oranges appear)
- [show whether or not a comparison/logical statement is correct - via checkmark] - not structure

so, rather than a button calling the addFruit function
it needs to check the value of the variables apple and orange on run
and render the correct number that's associated




also going to take out Nick's code until logic is correct, then add it back in
